Helping Hand

Helping Hand is an Android application that was developed as a course project for IAT 359 "Mobile Computing" at Simon Fraser University

Helping Hand is a senior's care mobile application which provides support to elderly users living independantly. It does this by reminding them of the medication they need and when to take them, adding appointments to their device's calendar, and allowing them to find their current location if they are lost; all of this in one convenient package.

Perhaps most importantly, this app provides peace of mind to themselves and their loved ones as it can alert an emergency contact if an accident occurs. If the user falls down with their phone, the device will sense the fall and initiate contact with a pre-determined individual. Additionally, if the user needs to make an emergency call or text, there is a clear "Emergency Help" button for them to use.

In this finali deliverable, I accomplished the basic and standard functionality that I had proposed for the application in the first milestone of the assignment. The application's fall detection was achieved by accessing the device's accelerometer and triggering the "Fall Detected" screen when the sensor registered at a faster speed than what was expected, simulating a fall or a sudden movement. The Add Contact and Emergency Call features were implemented next. "Add Contact" 

This application was built in Android Studio using Java for the app's functionality and XML for styling.
